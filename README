haver-tk 0.06 ("Lamp")
=========================

Haver's a new chat system similar to IRC,
but hopefully it is both more simple and more
flexible.

Haver will never replace IRC, rather it
is intended for a different niche: Fairly
small servers. Haver doesn't make any attempts
at doing multi-server stuff.

Why was haver written?
Because IRC is really... disorganized.
Having to user agents for keeping rooms registered
is just plain icky, in my opinion.

Also, writing the server, the clients,
devising a protocol that is simple, is
terribly fun stuff.

This is the Perl/Tk client for haver.
